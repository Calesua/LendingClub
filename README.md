# LendingClub Kaggle's database
Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), we build a Neural Network model that can predict wether or not a borrower will pay back their loan.

# Lending_Club_Neural_Network.ipynb is the work notebook
# Lending_Club_Neural_Network.pdf is a pdf that contains the notebook and shows the result of each cell
